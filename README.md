# swinging-needle-meter

A [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) application designed to display an example swinging needle meter, as an experiment in animating SVG from re-frame. Draws heavily on re-com.

Works well in Chrome and Firefox; not tested in Internet Exploder.

## Demo site

There's a demo site [here](https://simon-brooke.github.io/swinging-needle-meter/resources/public/index.html).

## Intended uses

This is a component for a console, typically one controlling a technical or scientific instrument. It is
by design flexible and configurable. Minimum value, maximum value, warning value and number of gradations
shown are all configurable, as are (obviously) styles.

A cursor will be shown if the value of *setpoint* is between *min-value* and *max-value*; *setpoint* is a dynamic value which is watched during the run. While the *model* value is within +- *tolerance* of the *setpoint* value, a class *target-class* is set on the meter indicating an on-target status (by default the frame goes green).

A red-zone may be shown if a *warn-value* is set which is between *min-value* and *max-value*. If such a *warn-value* is set, then if the current value (*model*) exceeds *warn-value*, a class *warning-class* is set on the meter indicating a warning status (by default the frame goes maroon).

## Usage

In your cljs file, require the following:

```clojure
  (:require [re-frame.core :as rf]
            [swinging-needle-meter.swinging-needle-meter :refer [swinging-needle-meter]])
```

within a [re-com](https://github.com/day8/re-com) component, 

```clojure
    [swinging-needle-meter
        :model     @(rf/subscribe [:old-value])
        :setpoint  @(rf/subscribe [:setpoint])          ;; optional
        :unit      @(rf/subscribe [:unit])              ;; optional
        :min-value @(rf/subscribe [:min-val])           ;; optional; default 0
        :warn-value @(rf/subscribe [:warn-val])         ;; optional; default 80
        :max-value @(rf/subscribe [:max-val])           ;; optional; default 100
        :tolerance 2                                    ;; optional; default 3
        :alarm-class "snm-warning"                      ;; optional; default "snm-warning"
        :gradations @(rf/subscribe [:gradations])       ;; optional; default 5
        :height    (int (* @(rf/subscribe [:size]) 6))  ;; optional; default 200 (pixels) 
        :width     (int (* @(rf/subscribe [:size]) 10))];; optional; default 300 (pixels)
```

or, minimally, just 

```clojure
    [swinging-needle-meter
        :model     @(rf/subscribe [:old-value])]
```

There are further arguments which may be set which are documented 
[here](https://simon-brooke.github.io/swinging-needle-meter/resources/public/index.html#parameters).

Obviously, all the subscriptions above must be registered with `re-frame/reg-sub`. See [re-frame documentation](http://day8.github.io/re-frame/re-frame/).

The value subscribed to as the value to `:model` is expected to be a floating point number between that of `:min-value` and `:max-value`. 

### Simulation of a mechanical meter needle with inertia and damping

You don't need animated movement, you can simply jerk the needle to its new position; animation appeals to users who are used to mechanical meters and is easy on the eye, but obviously it means the needle lags a little behind changes in the underlying state.

If you want animation, this is how it works.

The event registered to be driven by `:timer` in `swinging-needle-meter/events.cljs` drives the animation of the movement of the needle. The value of `:timer` is initialised in the state to `(js/Date.)` in `swinging-needle-meter/state.js`. Thus, it's a clock that ticks.

The actual value in the state which is tracked by the meter is the value of, in the example, `:target`. The `:timer` event moves `:old-value` progressively towards `:target` until they coincide. So in a real deployment you'd poll the actual real world value that you were tracking using a repeated asynchronous JSON request, and, on a response to such a request, you would update the value of `:target` in the state.

Obviously, if you want to put multiple meters onto one page tracking different real world variables, you would minimally have to have a separate key in the state for

1. The `target` of each meter;
2. the `old-value` of each meter (if animation is desired);

You might also want a separate key for the `warn-value` of each meter, and possibly also the `set-point`. Values of other parameters may be subscribed to from values in the state but it will probably be more convenient to hard-wire them or allow them to default.

## Development Mode

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

## Production Build

To compile clojurescript to javascript:

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```
