# swinging-needle-meter

A [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) application designed to display an example swinging needle meter, as an experiment in animating SVG from re-frame. Draws heavily on re-com.

Works well in Chrome and Firefox; not tested in Internet Exploder.

## Demo site

There's a demo site [here](https://simon-brooke.github.io/swinging-needle-meter/resources/public/index.html).

## Intended uses

This is a component for a console, typically one controlling a technical or scientific instrument. It is
by design flexible and configurable. Minimum value, maximum value, warning value and number of gradations
shown are all configurable, as are (obviously) styles.

A cursor will be shown if the value of *setpoint* is between *min-value* and *max-value*; *setpoint* is a dynamic value which is watched during the run. While the *model* value is within +- *tolerance* of the *setpoint* value, a class *target-class* is set on the meter indicating an on-target status (by default the frame goes green).

A red-zone may be shown if a *warn-value* is set which is between *min-value* and *max-value*. If such a *warn-value* is set, then if the current value (*model*) exceeds *warn-value*, a class *warning-class* is set on the meter indicating a warning status (by default the frame goes maroon).

## Development Mode

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

## Production Build


To compile clojurescript to javascript:

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```
